# FolderToPDF  

A simple tool to convert folder contents into a PDF or TXT file.  

## Features  

- **Directory Scanning**: Scans a specified folder and creates a PDF file from its contents.  
- **Customizable Filters**:  
  - Include files based on specific extensions (e.g., `js`, `py`).  
  - Exclude specific folders or files from the output.  
- **Profile System**: Save and switch between multiple filter configurations for quick access.  
- **Optional Data Processing**:  
  - Trim comments or sensitive information (basic implementation).  
- **Statistics**:  
  - Calculate the total number of lines in the processed files.  
  - Estimate the number of generative AI tokens (default for GPT-4).  
- **Drag & Drop Support**: Easily specify a folder by dragging it into the utility. 

The utility was created for personal use as a tool to simplify script debugging with the help of models.
Some features are still WIP. I apologize in advance for any inaccuracies and will do my best to fix them ❤️
